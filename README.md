# 📡 Telco Customer Churn

## 🎯 Project Objective

The main objective of this project is to predict customer churn in a telecommunications company using machine learning models 🤖📊
By identifying customers who are at high risk of churn, businesses can take proactive actions such as:

🎯 Targeted retention campaigns

💰 Pricing adjustments

🛠️ Service improvements

## 🚀 Models & Results

### 📌 1. LogisticRegression
We Develop a **Logistic Regression** model for this data and give this result:
Logistic Regression Results (Default Threshold = 0.3)
- Classification Report: 
 
| Class | Precision | Recall | F1-Score | Support |
|-------|-----------|--------|----------|--------|
| 0     | 0.89      | 0.75   | 0.82     | 1035   |
| 1     | 0.52      | 0.75   | 0.61     | 374    |

**Accuracy:** 0.75  
**Macro Avg:** 0.71  
**Weighted Avg:** 0.79  
**ROC-AUC:** 0.8408

Logistic Regression Results (Default Threshold = 0.5)

| Class | Precision | Recall | F1-Score | Support |
|------|----------|--------|----------|--------|
| 0 (No Churn) | 0.85 | 0.89 | 0.87 | 1035 |
| 1 (Churn) | 0.64 | 0.55 | 0.59 | 374 |

**Accuracy:** 0.80  
**Macro Avg (P / R / F1):** 0.74 / 0.72 / 0.73  
**Weighted Avg (P / R / F1):** 0.79 / 0.80 / 0.79  
**ROC-AUC:** 0.8408

---------------------------------------------------


###  🌲 2. Random Forest
#### RF_1:
I work on RF model and get this result:
-  Random Forest Results (Threshold = 0.5)
-  Classification Report

| Class | Precision | Recall | F1-Score | Support |
|------|----------|--------|----------|--------|
| 0 (No Churn) | 0.83 | 0.89 | 0.86 | 1035 |
| 1 (Churn) | 0.61 | 0.49 | 0.55 | 374 |

**Accuracy:** 0.78  
**Macro Avg (P / R / F1):** 0.72 / 0.69 / 0.70  
**Weighted Avg (P / R / F1):** 0.77 / 0.78 / 0.77

**ROC-AUC:** 0.83

- Note:
> Random Forest was evaluated as a non-linear model; however, it did not outperform Logistic Regression in terms of ROC-AUC and Churn Recall, likely due to the sparse and mostly linear nature of the dataset. Therefore, it was excluded from further consideration.

#### RF_2:
We use Grid Search cross-validation for find best Parameter for Data:
- BEST PARAMETER:
> class_weight={0: 1, 1: 2}
>
> min_samples_leaf=20
> 
> min_samples_split=10
> 
> n_estimators=500
> 
> random_state=42

**Weighted Avg (P / R / F1):** 0.81 / 0.69 / 0.71  

**ROC-AUC:** 0.85

## 📊 Model Comparison Summary

| Model | Threshold | Recall (Churn) | Precision (Churn) | ROC-AUC | Accuracy |
|------|----------|----------------|-------------------|--------|----------|
| Logistic Regression | 0.30 | 0.75 | 0.52 | 0.841 | 0.75 |
| Random Forest (Tuned) | 0.50 | 0.72 | 0.56 | 0.847 | 0.78 |
| XGBoost (Tuned) | 0.40 | **0.88** | 0.46 | 0.847 | 0.69 |

- Logistic Regression provides a strong baseline with stable performance and high interpretability.
- Random Forest captures non-linear patterns but does not significantly outperform Logistic Regression.
- XGBoost achieves the highest Churn recall, making it the best choice when identifying at-risk customers is the top priority.
- Lowering the decision threshold improves Churn recall at the cost of overall accuracy, which is acceptable in churn prediction use cases.

## 🧪 Evaluation Strategy

Due to class imbalance in the dataset (fewer churned customers), model evaluation focuses not only on accuracy but also on:

- 🎯 Recall for the Churn class (Class = 1)
- 📈 ROC-AUC score to measure overall discrimination ability
- ⚖️ Precision–Recall trade-offs based on different decision thresholds

In churn prediction problems, higher recall is often prioritized to minimize the number of missed churn customers.


## 🔍 Feature Engineering

To improve model performance and better capture customer behavior, several feature transformations and encodings were applied:

- ✅ Binary encoding for Yes/No categorical features
- 🧩 One-Hot Encoding for multi-class categorical variables such as:
  - Contract
  - InternetService
  - PaymentMethod
- 📏 Numerical scaling using Min-Max normalization for models sensitive to feature scale (e.g., Logistic Regression)

These steps help reduce model bias and improve learning efficiency, especially for linear models.

## 🔥 Final Conclusion

✅ Logistic Regression: strong & interpretable baseline

🌲 Random Forest: limited improvement

⚡ XGBoost: best recall for churn prediction

🎚️ Threshold tuning is critical for business impact

➡️ XGBoost with a lower threshold is recommended for real-world churn prevention
Overall, XGBoost with a lower decision threshold is recommended for identifying high-risk customers in real-world churn management scenarios.
